Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple Python script to automate sending daily email reports using the `smtplib` and `email` modules. For this example, we'll assume you're using Gmail as the SMTP server.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   You need to have `smtplib` and `email` which are part of Python's standard library, so no extra installation is necessary.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps on Gmail**:
   If you're using Gmail, you need to enable "Less Secure Apps" access or use an App Password if 2FA is enabled.

3. **Create the Python Script**:

Hereâ€™s the complete script:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email import encoders
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Email configuration
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
smtp_port = 587
email_user = 'your_email@gmail.com'
email_password = 'your_password'

# Email content
def create_email(subject, body, to_addr):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = email_user
    msg['To'] = to_addr
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    return msg

# Send email
def send_email(msg):
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(email_user, email_password)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(email_user, msg['To'], text)
        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

# Daily report creation
def generate_report():
    # Simulate a report as a text string. Replace this with actual report generation code.
    report = "This is your daily report.\nReport generated on: " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    return report

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    subject = "Daily Report"
    body = generate_report()
    to_addr = 'recipient_email@example.com'

    email_msg = create_email(subject, body, to_addr)
    send_email(email_msg)
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Imports**:
   - `smtplib` is used for sending emails.
   - `email.mime` modules are used for creating the email content and attachments.
   - `os` and `datetime` are used for report generation and managing file paths.

2. **Email Configuration**:
   - Set the SMTP server and port for Gmail.
   - Set your email address and password (ensure you handle these securely).

3. **Create Email Content**:
   - `create_email` function constructs the email with a subject, body, and recipient address.

4. **Send Email**:
   - `send_email` function connects to the SMTP server, logs in, and sends the email.

5. **Generate Report**:
   - `generate_report` function generates the daily report. Replace this with your actual report generation logic.

6. **Main Execution**:
   - The script sets the subject and body of the email and sends it to the specified recipient.

### Automating the Script to Run Daily

To run this script daily, you can use system scheduling tools:

- **Windows**: Task Scheduler
- **Linux**: Cron jobs

#### Example Cron Job Setup (Linux):

1. Open the crontab file:
   ```sh
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a new cron job to run the script every day at 8 AM:
   ```sh
   0 8 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your_script.py
   ```

This cron job will execute your Python script every day at 8 AM. Ensure the path to your Python interpreter and script are correct.

### Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords in your script. Use environment variables or secure vaults to store these details.
- **Email Security**: If using Gmail, prefer setting up App Passwords rather than enabling less secure apps. App Passwords can be generated in your Google Account settings if 2FA is enabled.

By following these steps, you can automate sending daily email reports with Python.
